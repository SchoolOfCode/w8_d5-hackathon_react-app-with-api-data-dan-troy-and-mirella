# imdb tv api that searches for films by an p box

## Dreamer Phase

1. favouriite button that adds teh film to another page
2. sort by popular films - display the top 10 movies on the home page before you search
3. button to give a ating out of 10
4. incorporate the tv api wit the search so it displays films and tv shows
5. add a filter by button that filters tv shows and movies - show onky tv shows or movies
6. Add user rating

## Realist

1. display the button as an icomn on the listItem component
   -- favourite button componemt
   -- function that says when clicked, add the div the film is contained in to another route
   -- check link troy sent in chat regarding favourite toggle
2. --On the home page, display the top 5movies and below it the top 5 tv shows

   - https://imdb-api.com/api/#Ratings-header

3. Not Realisitic in the time frame

4. Defo viable, useEffect with the api link, and using the inputValue

5. Next to the search box, have 2 checkboxes where you can choose to display just films or juts movies

- Hard to do, if we have time we will investigate further

6. Use the rating api to dispay it as part of the element, would need another useEffect to call it and another component
